# Management and Analysis of Physics Dataset (MOD.A) course (Physics of Data - Unipd)

This is the repository of the Management and Analysis of Physics Dataset (MAPD) course, and contains the assignments given by the professor during the lessons and the homework. The work is carried out in groups of 4 people. 

## Target skills and knowledge
The aims of the course is to provide basic knowledge about the hardware for data processing, transport and storage, focusing on real-time and on-line systems and to allow hands-on programming laboratory of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

The lectures will introduce basic knowledge of digital electronics, hardware computing, memory/storage elements and buses for data transport. The hand-on sessions will enable direct and detailed knowledge of FPGA logics and their programming through the VHDL hardware description language.
